 Hsinchu Open Data Hackathon
 
 We use the open data from HisChu City, and design a coreport transportation accident system for users to get the newest information.
 Besides, we also provide a Daily Reminder to provide some safety information. We draw fire departments, police stations, 
 hospitals, emergency places, AED locations, fire hydrants and so on on map so that users can access to to the location when emergency happens.
